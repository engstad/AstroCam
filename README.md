# AstroCam

My hobby project is to create a camera suitable for astronomy pictures. Here you can follow my work. It is slow going, since I don't have much time to allocate for this. So don't expect too many updates.

For now I have been focusing on three things:

1. understanding Analog Device's H-driver and ADC chip ADDI7013,
2. creating the power circuitry required for the many chips,
3. creating the PCB for the CCD camera chip.

So far, only V0.2 of the ADDI breakout board has been produced and I'm in the process of testing it:

And it works!

So, that means that I'll start working on the camera parts next.
